This is a book management application idealized to make proof-of-concept of Rails and RSpec technologies. Also, some articles will be write about the experience obtained and tips for better results.

This application seems to use:
- Auto-complete fields
- Flash upload files
- Functional testing using Cucumber

- and more...

I hope that's useful for you! :P
